# Courses

All university programs have a program plan that describes a set of courses which are possible to include within a university degree. These courses come in three flavours.

### Compulsory

These are the courses you have no say over and are deemed essential for your degree.

### Elective

Sometimes you have elective slots in your program plan, which means that you can select any course marked as _elective_ within your program plan.[^elective_caveat] For master students it may be interesting to know that you can read one or two courses (around 15hp) outside of your program plan and still get your masters degree. This can vary between programs so ask your **student counsellor** before deciding.

You can find your program plan on [Studieportalen](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/program_list) by searching for your programme.

### Compulsory elective

Your program plan sometimes contains a slot where you need at least X number of those courses. These courses are called compulsory electives. Usually, each slot marked as _compulsory elective_ have two to three courses of which you need at least one.

## Människa, teknik och samhälle (MTS)

MTS courses as their name implies, do not strictly have to be about your core subjects. Every student enrolled at a _Civilingenjörsprogram_ (TKDAT or TKITE) must take at least 7.5hp worth of courses marked as MTS.

## Miljö och hållbar utveckling (MHU)

Similar to MTS courses, you need at least 7.5 credits marked as MHU if enrolled at TKDAT or TKITE.

## Laborations

Laborations usually take place during the course, sometimes including the exam week for that course.
Laborations tend to have an associated number of the credits of the entire course.
This means that the exam rarely represents the entire 7.5 credits of a course, as it is split between labs and exam.
Most labs have to be handed in and sometimes even presented in class in order to pass.
**It is usually hard to redo these labs during the year if you fail, so it is recommend to prioritize them and complete them when the course is given.**
However, if you fail your laborations, you can still complete the exam and do
the labs the next time the course is held. This is often a hassle, so try to
stay on top of them!

## Schedule

The schedule for your courses can be found on [TimeEdit](https://cloud.timeedit.net/chalmers/web/public/).
There you can search for the schedule for individual courses, or entire years for the programs.
Once you have searched and gotten the schedule for what you were looking for, you can subscribe to said schedule and add it to your own calendar applications, such as Google Calendar.

Before every course starts you should go to the course canvas page to check the syllabus which may contain important information such as:

- Books and programs required for the course.
- How to sign up for labs.
- Additional scheduling not visible in TimeEdit.
- All compulsory activities of the course.

It is also important to read your student email as teachers or lab partners may contact you there. You should preferably do this daily daily or set up notifications so you know when an email arrives. **It is common for students to miss important updates because they do not feel the need to look at their email!**

It is your responsibility to stay up to date with published information in a timely manner.

[^elective_caveat]: There may still be prerequisite requirements.
