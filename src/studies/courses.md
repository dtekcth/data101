# Courses

All university programmes have a programme plan, a set of courses which are possible to include within a university degree. These courses come in three flavours.

### Compulsory

These are the courses you have no say over and are deemed essential for your degree.

### Elective

Sometimes you have elective slots in your programme plan, which means that you can select any course marked as _elective_ within your programme plan.[^elective_caveat] For master students it may be interesting to know that you can read one or two courses (around 15hp) outside of your programme plan and still get your masters degree. This can vary between programmes so ask your student counsellor before deciding.

You can find your on [Studieportalen](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/program_list) by searching for your programme.

### Compulsory elective

Your program plan sometimes contains a slot where you need at least X amount of those courses. These are called compulsory electives. Usually, each slot marked as _compulsory elective_ have two to three courses of which you need at least one.

## Människa, teknik och samhälle (MTS)

These courses as their name implies, do not strictly have to be about your core subjects. Every student enrolled at _Civilingenjörsprogram_ (TKDAT or TKITE) must take at least 7.5hp worth of courses marked as MTS.

## Miljö och hållbar utveckling (MHU)

Similar to MTS courses, you need at least 7.5hp if enrolled at TKDAT or TKITE.

## Laborations

## Schedule
The schedule for your courses can be found on [TimeEdit](https://cloud.timeedit.net/chalmers/web/public/).
There you can search for the schedule for individual courses, or entire years for the programmes.
Once you have searched and gotten the schedule for what you were looking for, you can subscribe to said schedule and add it to your own calendar applications, such as Google Calendar.

[^elective_caveat] There may still be prerequisite requirements.
