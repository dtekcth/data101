# FAQ

### Who are DNS? 

DNS is the Student Educational Committee for TKDAT. We help you contact your
teachers, professors and examiners to mediate in situations where you feel they
haven't respected you. If you have any questions regarding your rights as a
student or how your studies work, you can always ask us.

### My exam hasn't been reported

The examiner has 15 working days to report the exam to Ladok, but sometimes
there can be a delay between the examiner, the student office and Ladok. If the
exam still isn't showing up after 15 working days, please contact the examiner
and politely ask about it. If you have an important deadline such as CSN or
exchange studies you can always contact your examiner and ask if you can get
prioritized grading. **It is important for your own sake that you contact your
examiner well in advance of any upcoming deadline.**

You may also want to contact your Student Educational Committee in the case that
your problem is not resolved.

### Where can I find important dates?

Chalmers provides this [site](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/plan-and-conduct-your-studies/the-academic-year/) which has the current years academic plan.

### I forgot to apply for a course/exam

If you forgot to apply for a course, you might be able to fix it if you contact your Student Educational Committee, but there is no guarantee. You can also contact your Director of Studies (Utbildningssekreterare) or Student Guidance Councelor (Studiev√§gledare) directly.

If you forgot to apply for an exam, you will have to apply for the next re-exam and take that one. It is **not** possible to apply after the deadline by contacting the staff.

### I failed an exam or laboration

The only thing that can be done is to retake them at the next opportunity.
Exams that are in a program plan have to offer 3 exams during a year.
A laboration will usually have to be redone next year.

### Before and after an exam

Before your exam you should find where your exam will take place and at what
time. Write down your anonymous code on a small piece of paper, this is usually
allowed. If you forget it, the exam guards can give it to you. Try to be there
around half an hour in advance to have some time to prepare yourself. You will
not be allowed to have your phone near you as you are writing, make sure to turn
it, and any other smart devices off and placing them in your bag or jacket.
**Make sure to bring identification**, without it you will not be allowed to
write your exam. 

What is required to write an exam is a pen (with ink), a pencil and rubber
(unless you're very confident). If the exam allows for a calculator you may
bring one. However there is a list of permitted calculators, as well as other
information regarding preparation for exams
[here](https://www.chalmers.se/utbildning/dina-studier/tentamen-och-ovrig-examination/fore-examination/#praktiska-forberedelser-och-godkanda-hjalpmedel).
It is recommended to bring a water bottle or a drink, and something small to eat
during the exam to have energy to complete it. Peanuts and nuts are not allowed
due to allergies.

For more information on what to do before, during, and after an exam you can see
[this

### I feel badly treated by a teacher, teacher assistant or another student

There is a service known as [safe at chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/organisation-and-governance/safe-at-chalmers/) where you can report incidents.

### My lab group is having issues, what should I do?

The short answer is to act in some way.
Speak about it with the group to try to solve it.
You could talk with a teacher assistant that you feel comfortable with if you think that would help.

### My studies aren't going well, what can I do?

Contact your Student Guidance Councelor as soon as possible. They are experts who can help you get back on your feet.

### If you have further questions

For more information about your student rights you can see [this Chalmers
page](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/rights-and-obligations/).

It also includes important rules and information about various topics that might
be important to you as a student.
If something still feels off or you need someone to mediate for you, then you can contact your Student Educational Committee.
