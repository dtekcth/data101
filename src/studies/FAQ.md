# FAQ

**My exam hasn't been reported**
The examiner has 15 working days to report the exam to Ladok, but sometimes there can be a delay between the examiner, the student office and Ladok.
If the exam still isn't showing up after 15 working days, please contact the examiner and politely ask about it. If you have an important deadline such as CSN or exchange studies you can always contact your examiner and ask if you can get prioritized grading. **It is important for your own sake that you contact your examiner well in advance of any upcoming deadline.**

You may also want to contact your Student Educational Committee in the case that you problem is not resolved.

**Where can I find important dates?**
Chalmers provides this [site](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/plan-and-conduct-your-studies/the-academic-year/) which has the current years academic plan.

**I forgot to apply for a course/exam**
If you forgot to apply for a course, you might be able to fix it if you contact your Student Educational Committee, but there is no guarantee. You can also contact your Director of Studies (Utbildningssekreterare) or Student Guidance Councelor (Studiev√§gledare) directly.

If you forgot to apply for an exam, you will have to apply for the next re-exam and take that one. It is **not** possible to apply after the deadline by contacting the staff.

**I failed an exam or laboration**
The only thing that can be done is to retake them at the next opportunity.
Exams that are in a program plan have to offer 3 exams during a year.
A laboration will usually have to be redone next year.

**What should I bring to an exam?**
What is required to do an exam is a pen (with ink), pencil and rubber.
If the exam allows for a calculator, one can bring one of the allowed ones.
It is recommended to bring some form of water bottle or drink, and something small to eat during the exam to have energy to complete it. Peanuts and nuts in general are not allowed due to allergies.

**I feel badly treated by a teacher, teacher assistant or another student**
There is a service known as [safe at chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/organisation-and-governance/safe-at-chalmers/) where you can report incidents.

**My lab group is having issues, what should I do?**
The short answer is to act in some way.
Speak about it with the group to try to solve it.
You could talk with a teacher assistant that you feel comfortable with if you think that would help.
