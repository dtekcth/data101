# Masterprogrammes
This chapter is mostly meant for second and third year students, but is good
information to keep in mind for your entire time at chalmers so we still suggest
reading it. There are some planned changes to how choosing a master works at
some point in the future but we will attempt to keep this up to date with these
changes so check back here to make sure nothing has changed, and keep up with
news from chalmers regarding your masters choice!

During the 5 year programme called "Civilingenjör" you will be receiving two
degrees, a bachelors degree (Kandidatexamen in swedish) and your masters degree.
Oftentimes you will hear people say "during your bachelors", which refers to the
first 3 years. Some time in early april during your third year you will get to
choose your masters program. 

This can be an overwhelming choice, but one you will have a lot of time to
prepare for luckily! To give you an idea of which masters might seem interesting
we will have some information regarding the most popular masters here. 

## Applying to a masters-programme
There are a few important things to think about when choosing your masters.
Chalmers has mastersprogrammes that are "associated" with certain
bachelors-programmes. What this means is if you've studied at a
bachelors-programme, you have the opportunity to receive priority for certain
master degrees. There are however a few prerequisites for this. 

1. You need to have achieved the qualifications for the masters-programme.
2. You submit your declaration in time, i.e during the ordinariy masters-programme choice period.
3. In your declaration, include at least two of the masters-programmes covered by the priority.
4. Accept the spot you are given. If you do not accept it, you will have to do a late declaration during the summer, where you will not be guaranteed a spot.

To be qualified for the masters associated with your bachelors degree you
shouldn't have to do anything in particular except follow your programplan. This
means taking compulsory electives when given the chance and taking all of your
obligatory courses.

If you want to study a master which isn't associated with your bachelors
programme the application process will be a little different. If there are more
applicants than there are spots a selection will be made. First those with
priority from a different bachelor (or högskoleingenjörs-program) will be given
their guaranteed spots. After this the rest of the applicants will be ordered in
terms of the amount of högskolepoäng they have, with a limit of 157.5hp. If two
applicants in the same group have the same amount of hp, they will be ordered in
terms of average grade. If multiple students have the same average grade, then
a lottery is employed for those students.[^application]

## Masters associated with TKDAT
Mind you, your choice of master will not determine everything about your masters
studies, a large part of your courses will be electives, so you can pick courses
from other masters as well!
You might also be interested in checking the IT version of this page as those
masters are often very popular for TKDAT students as well.

### MPALG - Algorithms, languages and logic. 
MPALG is the most computer-science oriented master offered at Chalmers. It gives a large basis for software development but even more so for academic research in the computer-science field where chalmers is, and has been world leading in fields like functional programming and type-theory. 

The core of the programme covers:
- Algorithms, including AI, machine learning, and optimization techniques.
- Logic, and its applications in hardware and software verification.
- Advanced programming and implementation techniques, and a deeper approach to programming languages.
- Computer security, including cryptography and security from the perspective of programming.

### MPCSC - Computer systems and cybersecurity.
MPCSC is focused on giving you a strong basis for the digital society of the
modern world. The demand for reliable, complex systems that are secure and
efficient. The programme also provides a strong basis for doctoral studies and
research within areas like cybersecurity and real-time systems.

The core of the programme covers:
- A combination of theoretical knowledge and practical engineering.
- A comprehensive understanding of target hardware and software, as well as the middleware that tie these systems together.
- Designing systems to be able to fight cyber threats, secure ways to handle data and implementing protective measures.
- Preparing you to consider ethics and how to comply with industry standards.

### MPHPC - High-performance computer systems.
MPHPC is about keeping up with the large demands of modern computer systems like
autonomous vehicles and data centres, while taking into consideration the
increased constraints on energy and power. MPHPC also gives a strong foundation
for research focused on computer achitecture, reconfigurable computing and
parallel processing systems.

The core of the programme covers:
- The abilities needed to lead both software and hardware development for both general and specific applications designed for high performance.
- Teaching you to be on the forefront of technology and employing you with exper knowledge in computer architecture, parallel programming or sustainable and energy-efficient systems
- Advanced knowledge in high-performance computer systems and topics regarding it, such as reconfigurable architectures, real-time systems, AI, and computer graphics

## Masters associated with TKITE
Mind you, your choice of master will not determine everything about your masters
studies, a large part of your courses will be electives, so you can pick courses
from other masters as well!
You might also be interested in checking the Data version of this page as those
masters are often very popular for TKITE students as well.

### Data science and AI
Data science and AI is about just what it sounds like! This master is for those
who want to learn as much as they can about AI, large scale data processing, and
machine learning. In the current landscape this is incredibly sought after, both
in research and in the industry.

The core of the programme covers:
- Large scale data and machine learning.
- Educate engineers to develop software for data-intensive and AI-related applications.
- Teaching out both theory and practice.
- A solid foundation in statistics and optimization, with deep understanding for mathematical modelling techniques used to extract data from complex data sets.

### Interaction design and technologies
Interaction design and technologies is a master that aims to equip engineers to
develop digital applications, as more and more of our lives are taking place
online. Interaction designers are often tasked with designing the user
interface for these applications.

This programme is intended for those with a deep interest for interaction
between humans and technology. In this programme you will meet people from many
different academic bakgrounds. You will learn to work with well-established, but
also innovative technologies, like robots, virtual reality and virtual agents. 
The programme is primarily focused on software design, but there are also courses for developing phyiscal interfaces.

To read more see [the chalmers page about Interaction design and technologies](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/find-masters-programme/interaction-design-and-technologies-msc/).

### Software engineering and technology
Software engineering and technology is a master which aims to teach engineers to
develop dynamic software and hardware solutions, that can grow and change as
they develop. As the complexity of software increases so must the skill of the
engineers that develop it. 

The core of the programme is:
- Working with the industry and learning to become a team player that's supposed to work in big teams.
- Giving a strong foundation for advanced technical knowledge and skills.
- Advanced knowledge of methods, processes and industrial activities and practices. 
- The combination of technical prowess and industrial knowhow is highly valuable in the software industry.
