# Chalmers Apps

Chalmers has a digital platform to help you get some of the programs you need
for your courses. It's called [Chalmers Apps](https://apps.chalmers.se) and is
currently being introduced, so we don't know to what extent it will be used for
your education, but we will walk you through the basics of it here. If you want
Chalmers instructions, they are available
[here](https://www.chalmers.se/utbildning/studentstod/it-support/kor-chalmers-programvaror-pa-din-egen-dator/)

## Setup

{{ begin .windows }}

### AppsAnywhere

On Windows you can login to [Chalmers Apps](https://apps.chalmers.se) using
CID@chalmers.se as you username and the password you set for your CID. The
first time you do it you will be asked if you have installed AppsAnywhere.
Click on Install Now and it should start downloading. Follow the on screen
instructions. You should now have a pop-up saying "This site is trying to open
AppsAnywhere Launcher". Make sure the checkbox is ticked and click on Open. You
might get another pop-up saying that validation failed. In that case, click on
retry validation. If it succeeds, click on Close Troubleshooter. You should now
be finished with the installation. If you see the pop-up asking you if
AppsAnywhere is installed again, just click I Already Have It.

### Windows App

On Windows and MacOS you can use a program called Windows App to get access to
a virtual environment to access the programs. Download it from either Microsoft
Store or the App Store and login using your CID@chalmer.se and your CID
password. You will now get a welcome screen, click Skip in the bottom right
hand corner. Now you will be presented with a list of virtual desktops that you
can connect to. You should already have one called "Chalmers Apps". This is the
screen you will see when you start the program the next time.

Underneath the card that says "Chalmers Apps", there is a button that says
"Connect", press it. This will start up you virtual environment with
AppsAnywhere pre-installed and running. When you want to exit the virtual
environment, press the "X" in the toolbar at the top of the screen.

### Web interface

If you're on Linux, you have to run it from the web. Go to [Chalmers
Apps](https://apps.chalmers.se) and log in using CID@chalmers.se and your CID
password. From here, click on any program, and then Launch, and then "Launch
the virtual desktop client". You will be taken to a list of virtual
environments, with one named Chalmers Apps.

Click on it and you should enter into the virtual environment.

{{ end }}

## Using it

Now that you are all setup, go to the [Chalmers Apps](https://apps.chalmers.se)
website again and login as before. Search for the program you want to start and
click on Launch. AppsAnywhere should now download the program for you and
launch it once it is ready.

When AppsAnywhere is running, you can use it to quickly access Chalmers Apps.
Do this by pressing the up arrow in the task bar and then right clicking on the
AppsAnywhere icon, then pressing "Launch Portal". This should take you to the
website where you can now search for programs and run them.
