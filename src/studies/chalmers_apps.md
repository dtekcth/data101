## Chalmers Apps

Chalmers has a digital platform to help you get some of the programs you need for your courses. It's called [Chalmers Apps](https://apps.chalmers.se) and currently being introduced so we don't know to what extent it will be used, but we will introduce it here if you need it. For now we don't think it will be used very much for your computer engineering courses, but that might change in the future. Here we will walk you through setting everything up and how to use it. If you want Chalmers instruction they are available [here](https://www.chalmers.se/utbildning/studentstod/it-support/kor-chalmers-programvaror-pa-din-egen-dator/)

### Setup

{{ begin .windows }}

Login to [Chalmers Apps](https://apps.chalmers.se) using CID@chalmers.se as you username and the password you set for your CID. The first time you do it you will be asked if you have installed AppsAnywhere. Click on Install Now and it should start downloading. Follow the on screen instructions. You should now have a pop-up saying "This site is trying to open AppsAnywhere Launcher". Make sure the checkbox is ticked and click on Open. You might get another pop-up saying that validation failed. In that case, click on retry validation. If it succeeds, click on Close Troubleshooter. You should now be finished with the installation. If you see the pop-up asking you if AppsAnywhere is installed again, just click I Already Have It.

{{ end }}

{{ begin .windows .macos }}

On Windows and MacOS you can use a program called Windows App. Download it from either Microsoft Store or the App Store and login using your CID. Here you will see one workspace already set up for you. Click on it and it should start a remote connection to the StuDat servers.

{{ end }}

{{ begin .linux }}

If you're on Linux you can only run it through the web.

{{ end }}

### Using it

If you installed AppsAnywhere onto your computer, you can go to the [Chalmers Apps](https://apps.chalmers.se) website and login as before. Search for the program you want to start and click on Launch. AppsAnywhere should now download the program for you and launch it once that is done.
