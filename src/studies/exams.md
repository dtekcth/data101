# Exams

Exams are held thrice a year for each obligatory course, usually organized as follows. First in the exam period following the course, then once more in the re-exam period of the following period. All courses have re-exams in August as well. To find exact dates you can search [here](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/examdates_list).

The rules for courses and examination are found [here](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/your-studies/examinations-and-other-summative-assessments/during-and-after-the-examination-session/).

Some general advice not found on Chalmers website can be found below.

## Preparing for an exam

Aside from reviewing the material from class you might also be interested in looking at old exams. Old exams and solutions can be found through several channels.

- The examiner should provide some example exams on the canvas page.
- You can email the student expedition and ask for old exams and solutions. Every department has their own expedition but most exams relating to computer science can be requested from [student_office.cse@chalmers.se](mailto:student_office.cse@chalmers.se). Please keep in mind that their response time might be over a week.
<!-- - You can find exam statics on [this page](https://tenta.chs.se), which is organised by students. -->

## During the exam

As a student, you have certain rights and obligations which you should be aware of. The exam guards do not always know the regulations and it is therefore important for **you** to be informed of your rights. You can find the

- You do not need to bring your student ID, _but you do need to bring a normal photo ID_
- If you are suspected of cheating you may still complete your exam! The guards are not allowed to stop you and any such attempts should be reported.
- The exam guards are however allowed to stop you from writing the exam in case you are interrupting others a significant amount. So remain calm, do not shout at the exam guards that they are wrong!
- Should something go wrong, then you will be given extra time to compensate.

## After the exam

The examiner **must** post solutions to the exam by the next working day and the results should be posted on Ladok within 15 working days. If the results are not posted by this time, contact the examiner, and if you can not get an answer from them as to why, contact your Student Educational Committee!

If you feel that some of your rights have been violated or that something else has gone wrong, please contact your Student Educational Committee. They will know how to fix any problem related to your exams.
