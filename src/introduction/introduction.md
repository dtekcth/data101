# Introduction

Congratulations! You are about to take your first steps towards becoming not
only a programmer, but a computer scientist or engineer! This book aims to
provide you with the tools and context that you will need during your
university years, especially related to programming and computing.

This material will also try to create a common ground so that assumptions can
be made in later courses. For example we will teach you how to use _Git_, a
tool made for tracking version history of files, that is very important for
collaboration, both in your courses and in the workplace.

> This book will use the official program codes: TKDAT (Datateknik 300hp),
> TKITE (Informationsteknik 300hp) and N1COS (Datavetenskap 180hp) instead of
> the full names.

## Who is this for?

This book mainly targets those who have just started a program relating to
computer science and have no, or very little, previous knowledge. This means
that we try to write as clearly as possible even if it means being redundant.

As this book is written and maintained by DNS we will also have some information
from us regarding courses and your student rights at Chalmers. We urge all TKDAT
students to read through everything under the "Courses" and "Studies" categories
because this is the main place we will be sharing useful information for your
studies.

> {{ .DV .IT }} Much of this information applies to TKITE and N1COS as well!

If your only experience comes from a course or two during _Gymnasiet_ then you
should still find useful information here but may find the steps to be a bit too
granular. Hopefully, you can look past this! If you're even more experienced
than that, we still urge you to at least have a look through, there could still
be useful information here!

## Structure

> Note that if you print this book images may not be included as they are
> supposed to. Reading this guide on the web is recommended.

Begin by reading the beginner chapters sequentially. These will prepare you for
your real courses and can be deemed as essential. We will go through each topic
from the bottom up and each sub-chapter is meant to be self-contained, meaning
you can take 10 minutes and read a small bit every day. To receive the greatest
benefits, these should preferably be read during the reception or the start of
your studies. Once you have read all the beginner chapters you can progress to
whichever chapters you are interested in.

**We cannot stress enough how important it is that you actually try what you
are reading.** Just like any other craft, it is impossible to master computer
tools without hands-on experience.

Under _studies_ you will find course-specific information. These chapters
provide specific tips & tricks from older students and should generally be
looked at just before beginning the course and can be used as a reference
during the course. You will also find guidance on how your studies are
structured and what choices you should make. These become more relevant later
in your education but we still recommend that you become familiar with the
[basics](./studies/index.md) and [exams](./studies/exams.md).

> Boxes like these are used to give interesting information or context that is
> not necessary to understand the guide but can provide further reading or
> useful tips for those interested.

## If you get stuck

While we have tried to be as thorough as possible, there might still be cases
we haven't thought about. Feel free to email the authors any questions you
might have. You can reach them at [dns@dtek.se](mailto:dns@dtek.se).

## The student division

For Data students we have a Discord [here](https://discord.gg/nu3SWDUwHH) where
we also post news regarding the student division. We also share information
from the program or from us regarding deadlines or things of importance for
you! Make sure you sign up in order not to miss anything!

## Lectures

There will be two lectures where we go through some of the early chapters. The
first lecture we will go through how to use the CLI, the editor and some
general information. The authors will also be available during the _PISS-kväll_
in the afternoon to help you. The second lecture will primarily cover Git. This
lecture is if anything _more_ important than the first so please come to both!

The authors will also be attending the _hackkväll_ at 18:00 in NC (Idéläran)
and will be assisting you with any problem you might be having!
