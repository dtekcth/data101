# Course tips and tricks

The following pages consist of tips and tricks for effective studies in some
specific courses. They also serve as a way to share tips and tricks for
debugging, finding libraries, and documentation for the programming languages
used in these courses.

Do you have tips and tricks to share? Things that you felt helped you when you
took the course? Or perhaps tips on where to go if you liked a course and would
like to know more? Feel free to contribute!
