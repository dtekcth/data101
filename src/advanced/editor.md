# Advanced usage of your editor

This section lists features that are useful for everyone but have more complex
uses. It is recommended that you have at least started to write some code—even
if it's just in the intro course—before looking at this. Otherwise it may be
    difficult to understand what these techniques do or why you would want to
    use them.

## Shortcuts

First you should know that it is possible to edit the editor shortcuts by
searching for `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts` in the command palette.
You can also search for shortcuts here. The default shortcuts are primarily
designed for users with American keyboard layouts and as such, some of them
will be very unwieldy to use. Make your editor yours by changing as many
shortcuts as you'd like!

### Compose keys

Some shortcuts require multiple keypresses. You can enter compose mode by
pressing !kbd[!ctrl+K] and then your desired shortcut. For example, opening the
menu to edit shortcuts can be opened by first pressing !kbd[!ctrl+K] followed
by !kbd[!ctrl+S].

### Next error

If your code has errors you can easily go to the next error by pressing
!kbd[!ctrl+'].

### Format your code

It is easy to write messy code in the beginning. This makes it difficult for
TAs and your friends to help you. It is recommended to enable the `Editor:
format on save` option in the preferences so that your code will automatically
be formatted when you save. It is also possible to manually format using
!kbd[!ctrl+Shift+I].

> Formatting does not work when you have syntax errors so if the command
> doesn't do anything you might have to fix your code first!
