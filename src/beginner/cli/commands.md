## Common commands

Now that you know the basics of how paths work and how to interact with a terminal, we will present some common commands in more rapid succession. We will also list the commands we have already covered so you can use this as a quick reference.

If you want to know more about a command you can either use `command --help` to print a quick reference, or use `man <command>` to get more thorough documentation. The latter option can be a bit unintuitive to use at first, but you can use the arrow keys to move up and down, and `q` to exit out of the viewer.

`cat <files>` (con**cat**enate): Print the contents of the `<file>`. Specifying multiple files will print all of them.

`cd <path>` (**c**hange **d**irectory): Changes your working directory to `<path>`.

`cp <source> <destination>` (**c**o**p**y): Copies files from `<source`> to `<destination>`.

`cp --recursive <source> <destination>` (**c**o**p**y): Copies directories and their contents from `<source`> to `<destination>`.

`ls <path>` (**l**i**s**t): Lists the files in `<path>`.

`ls` (**l**i**s**t): Lists the files in the working directory.

`mkdir <directories>` (**m**a**k**e **dir**ectory): Create the `<directories`>.

`mv <source> <destination>` (**m**o**v**e): Moves files or directories from `<source>` to `<destination>`.

`rm -r <directories>` (**r**e**m**ove): Removes the `<directories>` and all of their contents.

`rm <files>` (**r**e**m**ove): Removes the `<files>`.

`touch <files>`: Creates the `<files>`.
