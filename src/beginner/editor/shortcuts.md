# Using shortcuts

While the mouse is very useful most of the time when using a computer,
programming is not necessarily one of those times. Programming is made far
easier by using the keyboard for actions you'd normally do with the mouse. Every
single action that can be done using your mouse can also be done without lifting
your fingers from the keyboard.

You may be tempted to click on the screen to move the caret, save your file or
create a new file, and while this works, it isn't very fast, and requires moving
your cursor a whole lot. Instead use keyboard shortcuts! In the beginning, you
may not notice how much faster this is but as you go through the semester it
will become second nature to you.

Below you can find some of the most commonly used shortcuts in our
[cheatsheet](/assets/autogen/editor_cheatsheet.pdf). If you have a hard time
memorizing them feel free to print one for yourself and bring it along in your
backpack as a way to remind yourself of what you can do with the editor. It can
also be useful to use this as a reference during the rest of this tutorial, but
don't worry if you don't understand what all the shortcuts do yet.

<!-- TODO: Is this task needed anymore as we introduce this shortcut in the
previous sub-chapter? -->

[Task]
Try writing some text on a new line. What happens if you press !kbd[!ctrl+x]
without selecting any text?

[Solution]
The entire line gets cut, meaning it is put in the clipboard and can be pasted
elsewhere.
