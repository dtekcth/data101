# Cooperation

This chapter will be all about working together and it is also one of our longest. This is something you will be doing constantly during your time at Chalmers. Your programming courses will most likely contain labs or assignments to be done together with others, and sometimes even your math courses do.  Therefore it is crucial to have a good environment set up to be able to work with a group. 

It's very common for new students to gather around a single computer, or writing code separately and just testing which is best. Others share files over Discord or Snapchat and this can lead to major issues when you're working at the same time or if you've missed a message. 

To facilitate group work we will be recommending two tools. The first is Git—the stupid content tracker—and liveshare, a VSCode plugin.

## What is Git

Git is a set of tools that help you track the changes you make to your text files. Git helps you collaborate with others by keeping track of who did what, as well as guiding you in merging your different versions of files. Git lets you be fearless when changing your code, safe in the knowledge that previous versions of your code are easy to access.

This chapter will probably feel very long compared to the others but it is also the most important and is why we needed all the other chapters to build up to it. Knowing Git is a crucial skill and there are many good and important reasons for learning.

- It's used in virtually every software-related job on the planet. Be it backend work, programming, systems development or a role as system administrator, you will most likely be using Git.
- It's incredibly useful in your courses, and even required in a few. Being able to write code simultaneously and to work on different parts of the code at once is a requirement for effective work.
- Easy to use but lots to learn. There are way more things we won't go through in this mini-course but that can improve your work flow a whole lot.

In this tutorial, we will guide you through setting up the necessary software and accounts for a modern Git experience. We will also introduce you to the basic concepts of version control. 

To make Git a bit easier to understand we will primarily be using the Git integration built in to VSCode! We will also go through how to use Git in the terminal for those of you who prefer the CLI.

## Liveshare

Liveshare is a plugin for VSCode which lets you connect to someone else's computer and basically work inside their VSCode session. It has support for multiple people working in the same file and in different files at the same time and can be very useful for when you want to work in the same place in a group. This on the other hand will most likely be most useful to you during your studies and lose relevance a bit during your career. But it is graphical, easy to use and a bit more intuitive than Git can be at times.

We'll have one sub-chapter in this tutorial for how to set it up, how to use it and some easy pitfalls that can be an issue.
