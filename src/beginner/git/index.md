# Cooperation

This chapter will be all about working together and it is also one of our
longest. This is something you will be doing constantly during your time at
Chalmers. Your programming courses will most likely contain labs or assignments
to be done together with others, and sometimes your math courses do as well.
Therefore it is crucial to have a good environment set up to be able to work
with a group. 

It's very common for new students to gather around a single computer, or to
write code separately and test which is best before turning it in.
Others share files over Discord or Snapchat and this can lead to major issues
when you're working at the same time or if you've missed a message. 

To facilitate group work we will be recommending two tools. The first is Git—the
stupid content tracker—and liveshare, a VSCode plugin which we will go through
in 4.7.

## What is Git

Git is a set of tools that help you track the changes you make to your text
files. Git helps you collaborate with others by keeping track of who did what,
as well as guiding you in merging your different versions of files. Git lets you
be fearless when changing your code, safe in the knowledge that previous
versions of your code are easy to access.

This chapter will probably feel very long compared to the others but it is also
the most important and is why we needed all the other chapters to build up to
it. Knowing Git is a crucial skill and there are many good and important reasons
for learning.

- It's used in virtually every software-related job on the planet. Be it backend
  work, programming, systems development or a role as system administrator, you
  will most likely be using Git.
- It's incredibly useful in your courses, and even required in a few. Being able
  to write code simultaneously and to work on different parts of the code at
  once is a requirement for effective work.
- Version control can be a life saver, for both personal and collaborative
  projects. It serves as a backup system in case your hardware breaks, but also
  lets you go back to older versions or test different feature implementations.
  

In this tutorial, we will guide you through setting up the necessary software
and accounts for a modern Git experience. We will also introduce you to the
basic concepts of version control. 

To make Git a bit easier to understand we will primarily be using the Git
integration built in to VSCode. We will also go through how to use Git in the
terminal for those of you who prefer the CLI.
