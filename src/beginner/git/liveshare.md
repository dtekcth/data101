# Liveshare
Liveshare is a plugin for VSCode which lets you connect to someone else's computer and basically work inside their VSCode session. It has support for multiple people working in the same file and in different files at the same time and can be very useful for when you want to work in the same place in a group. This on the other hand will most likely be most useful to you during your studies and lose relevance a bit during your career. But it is graphical, easy to use and a bit more intuitive than Git can be at times.
