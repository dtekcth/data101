# Git - Version Control

_A must-have tool for every computer engineer, developer, or really anyone who
writes text documents regularly._

Git is a set of tools that help you track the changes you make to your
text files. Git helps you collaborate with others by keeping track of who did
what, as well as guiding you in merging your different versions of files. Git
lets you be fearless when changing your code, safe in the knowledge that
previous versions of your code are easy to access.

Git is something one will have to use during the program. In project courses,
the bachelor's and master's theses it is almost always a requirement. And in
nearly every course you will have assignments where collaboration will be far
easier if you and your lab partner know and use Git. In addition to this, Git is
one of the most used tools in the industry. A true industry standard, you will
not find a job after your education that does not require it!

In this tutorial, we will guide you through setting up the necessary software
and accounts for a modern Git experience. We will introduce you to the basic
concepts of version control. Finally, we will show a basic workflow for
collaboration with Git in the typical programming assignments you will encounter
in the program.

We do not assume that you are comfortable in the terminal, and will strongly
advise using the graphical program GitKraken to handle your git needs. This is
an excellent tool, that helps pedagogically visualize the version control
concepts. Do note that most users of Git do use the terminal commands. If you
are comfortable in the terminal or would prefer to learn that way right away,
look no further than this
